# squeezeLine milestones:

## A little/big compromise =) :

Given that **I'm really new to everything related to C++**,\
I should target a **feasible and easy goal** by splitting the "project wannabe" ( look at the end of this page ) into different steps.\
I need to get confidence on language basics and then move forward to learn more complex stuff.\
**I will start with little implementations that run with NO user graphical interface**, to keep everything even more simple at start.


## All that being said
Some consideration about the ![dev environment here](./dev_environment.md)


## milestone: getting the environment set up
Writing a Class that does a sum and write/setup it's unit test.


## milestone: getting user input, generating output
Thinking to the pc keyboard like a "piano" keyboard.\
The application will listen to keystrokes ( on pc keyboard ) and \
will output the corresponding note NAME ( C, C#, D, and so on... )


## milestone: correct timing
Generating an event at a given "BPM". "BPM" should be variable by user input ( +/- )


## other milestones:

[...] still need to decide what's next.


## "A bit far" milestone:

* Given the final goal of ths project (see the last milestone below ), it would help to **leave beside** the whole **GPIO stuff**:\
  we could have the UI being controlled via a chosen MIDI channel among the 16 available reading a standard MIDI input.
* Since, as "project final goal", a raspberry Pi was chosen just to have a broadly known target platform with GPIO,\
  it will be more convenient to **develop on a generic linux machine** in the first place .

This could be the next big goal:

## "final" milestone:
