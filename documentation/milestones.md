# squeezeLine milestones:

## A little/big compromise =) :

Given that **I'm really new to everything related to C++**,\
I should target a **feasible and easy goal** by splitting the "project wannabe" ( look at the end of this page ) into different steps.\
I need to get confidence on language basics and then move forward to learn more complex stuff.\
**I will start with little implementations that run with NO user graphical interface**, to keep everything even more simple at start.


## All that being said
Some consideration about the [dev environment here](./dev_environment.md)


## milestone: getting the environment set up
Writing a Class that does a sum and write/setup it's unit test.


## milestone: getting user input, generating output
Thinking to the pc keyboard like a "piano" keyboard.\
The application will listen to keystrokes ( on pc keyboard ) and \
will output the corresponding note NAME ( C, C#, D, and so on... )


## milestone: correct timing
Generating an event at a given "BPM". "BPM" should be variable by user input ( +/- )


## more milestones :

[...] still need to decide what's next.


## "A bit far" milestone:
A big step towards the final result:\
[Project reasonable big goal](./project_big_step.md)


## ultimate milestone:
[These ideas](./project_wannabe.md) explaing the project goal.
