MIDI sequencer

I'd like to learn C and C++ programming. Since I need a MIDI sequencer, I think I could start from there =) .


The intended target platform would be linux .
The final idea would be to have a MIDI sequencer controlled by a "physical" interface.

Hopefully no mouse, no keyboard. Just a screen and knobs, buttons.
Was thinking to use something like GPIO on raspberry, for instance.
